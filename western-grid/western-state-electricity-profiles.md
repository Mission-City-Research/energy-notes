Note: Arizona had a significantly higher generation total - 116 TWh in 2024, compared to total retail sales of approximately 91 TWh.  This means that Arizona exports a good chunk of its electricity generation.

One example of this is a portion of the Palo Verde nuclear power plant's generation exported to the LA area in California.
